I am a Ph.D student in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) 
at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) hosted by Prof. [Yingwei Luo](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1092/1797.htm), Prof. [Xiaolin Wang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1083/1703.htm), and assistant Prof. [Diyu Zhou](https://zhou-diyu.github.io/). 

Before coming to PKU, I received my B.S. in computer science from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2022.


Research
======
My research is in the general area of computer systems. I am specifically 
interested in operating systems, cache systems, software/hardware co-design, and recently 
systems for machine learning.
